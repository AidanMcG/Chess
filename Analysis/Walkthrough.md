# **Walkthrough**  
 As a group we sat down together and had a walkthrough of the game to find issues. We used CRC cards to help us see the whole program. 
  
 **As a result of the walkthrough we came up the following changes:**  
* We decided to have each piece type inherit from an abstract "Piece" class rather than having each piece type as a separate class like we had originally planned  
* We gained a better understanding for the associations between the classes and the cardinality between some classes aswell as the different types of relationships between the classes  
* We decided to change our original plan of having classes of "Game", "Player" and "Piece" to "Gamestate", "Board" and "Tile".
